<p><strong>Chair Gym Weight Limit</strong>, For users with limited mobility the MCW chair scale comes with a built-in weighing device that can accurately take the weight and BMI of the user without the need to stand directly on a weighing scale. Because it facilitates tools that you can use when doing lots of exercises. Also if the design engineer was tasked to create a chair at those weight restrictions and they are fairly competent at their job they probably designed the chair with a safety factor of 15 and therefore the maximum weight the chair is designed for is 225 lbs.</p>
