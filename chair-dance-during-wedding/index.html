<p><strong>Chair Dance During Wedding</strong>, This is a dance where everyone sings along and dances around the bride and groom holding hands until the snake starts making its way through a bridge created by the bridegroom ducking under them as they stand tall on chairs. All the couples including the Bride Groom are invited onto the dance floor. I would advise against the empty chair thing because I think it can be a little difficult for people and distracts from the ceremony.</p>
