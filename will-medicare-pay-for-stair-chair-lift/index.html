The cost of a straight rail stair lift is typically around 2200 to 5000 with installation based upon the make and model. Does Medicare cover the cost of stair lifts. If you have a Medicare Advantage plan check with your provider. Traditional and Supplemental Medicare policies dont cover stair lifts sometimes called chair lifts or glide lifts but seniors who need one may still be able to get financial help.</p>

<p>Stair Lifts Chair Glides Accessible Systems Stair Lifts Chair Lift Stair Lift Medicare will only help cover a motorized chair lifting device prescribed by doctors and provided through DME suppliers enrolled in Medicare. It is logical to begin here as it is a common question relevant to most American seniors. While Medicare typically wont pay for a lift chair in full Medicare Part B Medical Insurance or Medicare Part C Medicare Advantage may cover the seat-lift mechanism as durable medical equipment DME if your doctor determines that. Unfortunately standard health insurance policies and Medicare will not typically cover the purchase or installation of a stair lift even with a doctors order. They are considered durable medical equipment DME used to treat certain conditions like arthritis or other balance or mobility issues. If you have a Medicare Advantage plan check with your provider.</p>

IPLs are not designed for a person to operate while standing on the platform. However Medicaid would only cover the most basic platform wheelchair lift for stairs or vertical platform lift. While patient lifts are listed on Medicares website as part of DME coverage stair lifts unfortunately do not fall into this category. Medicare Part C also known as Medicare Advantage plans might pay for lift chairs as well.
