I wanted to give Steelcase a shot. As you sit and move Steelcase Series 1 responds automatically to provide comfortable resistance as you recline. With 11 knit flexor and lumbar colors as well as a wide range of shell fabric and finishes the Series 1 offers an abundance of material and design options. There are more comfortable chairs for those that plan to use it regularly but it is a good option for a home office that gets mild to moderate use or for anyone who isnt planted to. On Amazon with both fully adjustable armrests and optioned out the Series 1 comes out to 408 and the Series 2 comes out to 580.</p>

The optional adjustable lumbar support lets you dial in comfort even further. Steelcase Series 1 was thoughtfully designed with integrated LiveBack technology adaptive bolstering and 4D adjustable arms delivering the dynamic performa. After looking at several Steelcase options I came across the Series 1 and thought it hit all my high points - lower lumbar support adjustments for seat depth and seat height and adjustable arms. The Steelcase Think is a high-end chair with a price to match but its. Its billed as something of a hybrid between a self-adjusting design and something more fully-featured.</p>

I knew I needed a good quality chair and I had noticed my hip NEVER hurt while at work using my Leap chair. According to some reviews the armrests are too easy to move and somewhat flimsy. Mon - Fri 8AM - 8PM EST. When designing Series 1 the team refused to waver on performance yet had to reach an accessible price point.

<p>Steelcase Leap Traditional Chairs Chair Task Chair The armrests seem to only be height adjustable and it doesnt appear to have adjustable lumbar Ive not inspected it in person yet Im just going off of what I can see in pictures. I wanted to give Steelcase a shot. None of our testers liked the Steelcase Series 1 complaining that it was too short the arms were too tall and it was generally uncomfortable for sitting longer than a couple of hours at a time. It retains everything thats valued in a chair while making it attainable for everyone. Starting in the high 300s the Series 1 is the most affordable task chair in the Steelcase seating portfolio.
