<p><strong>Chair Rail Upside Down</strong>, Chair rail moulding is a great way to spruce up a room and protect its walls from wily and dangerous chair backs. A thirty six inch height also means the rail will be interrupted by the vanity so if you use a top molding thats thicker than the typical 34 backsplash you have to 45 it back or return it which again looks funny to my eye. The main skirting board or chair rail profiles can then be simply snap-fitted on these cleats.</p>
