<p>Herman Miller Embody Review 2021 Why It S Not Worth The Money Amazingly ergonomic headrests designed engineered and manufactured by Herman Miller veterans. The headrests would have a problem finding a solid anchor point bc the spine of the chair is design to move with you so the headrest would also move with you as you lean back which will not be a good fit. This will be a game changer for people on the fence between the embody and Aeron but went with the aeron because of the headrest. However it is worth it. It has a soft yet stylish feel to it. However it is worth it.</p>
