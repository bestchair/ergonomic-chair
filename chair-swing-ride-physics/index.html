<p><strong>Chair Swing Ride Physics</strong>, Developed in the early 1800s by Franz Schwarzkopf the fairground ride is a variation of the carousel in which chairs are suspended by chains from the rotating top of a carousel. Suppose the total mass of a chair and its occupant is 204 kg. A swing ride at a carnival consists of chairs that are swung in a circle by 150-mathrmm cables attached to a vertical rotating pole as the drawing shows.</p>
